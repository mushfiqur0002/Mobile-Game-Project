# Introduction
For this project, the Rapid Prototyping methodology will be used, to create a quick prototype of the game to visualise simple mechanics and features,
to judge the variability of the game.
In the second iteration, the game will be further refined and then published on the Google Play store.

# Week 1
In the first week, the focus was researching popular mobile games to get some inspiration. The genres targeted were Hyper Casual and puzzle.
The first week's task was to test many popular games within the genres.
 
# Week 2

In the second week, the focus shifted from new games to old games, where I was able to find some old gems.

Game 1: doodle jump
Doodle Jump is a classic  mobile game, very famous with simple mechanics but very addictive. Requires minimum effort from the user to play it.
Unfortunately, it doesn't have unique mechanisms that are available only on smartphones.
Remaking this game with my own twist, it will involve re-designing the gameplay by adding some unique features that benefit from the mobile phone hardware.

Game 2: Super Rub a dub
Super Rub a dub is also another popular game but on the console, The player has to use a gyroscope to move around and collect objectives.
A remake will require, a new theme with funny and interactive mechanics to revamp this type of gameplay.

## Competitors

Roller Splat is a hyper-casual puzzle game, with an arcade level system. 
It uses bright colours and simple animation to attract players.

- Free to play 
- 10M + Installs 
- PEGI 3 (for everyone)
- Monetisation ADS
- It has 30k plus active users, latest download is 777.


After considering the pros and cons of remaking one of the mentioned games.
I decided to create my original version of Super Rub a dub.
The existing game has decent mechanics, but it’s not appealing enough and advanced enough to benefit from modern smartphone hardware.

On the second week, I also started setting up the project on Unity for mobile game development.

# Week 4

## Development

Week 4 is the beginning of Prototyping.
This week's focus were the following:
- Create a quick scene to test gyro control with a simple sphere on a flat plane. 
- Test collectable mechanics and display the amount on the screen

The player has to collect the " stars as collectables and a counter is displayed on the top.
More game levels are being added.
### Level 2

### Level 3

### Level 4

The physics works decently but requires some adjustments, also the collectable mechanics works fine for now.
The next step is to create a Menu system and more basic scenes.

# Week 5

This Week's focus was on the Menu system and its correct functionality. 
The player should be able to select the game level, play, pause and restart when needed.

### Prototype Menu page
![image](https://github.com/rahman0002/Mobile-Game-Project/assets/91261400/19ea9552-3341-4318-a517-0d2b8df30f52)
### Example demo
https://github.com/rahman0002/Mobile-Game-Project/assets/91261400/e7c27ceb-2654-421b-820e-9a18d3c56932

The basic menu system is ready, the user now can navigate through the menu system, select a level, pause, restart the game and manage volume.
Additionally, basic ads were implemented.
Testing was done using interstitial ads, the objective for the future is to use these ads in a specific way without ruining the gameplay.

# Week 6

Finalizing gameplay and presentation.
This week's tasks were the following:
 - Add some assets (collectables and enemy)
 - Completing creation of basic scene for 5 levels.
 - Creating a presentation for the prototype created.

# Week 7

This week's objective, start adding assets in each game level and finalizing the level design.
The aim is to use simple low poly assets and bright colours to make each game level more appealing.

Each game level will be different, and it will progressively get darker as the difficulty increases.
The original idea was to have a very friendly and green environment at the beginning, then each level it will decrease, as the enemy starts to appear further in the levels.

All the assets were positioned carefully to not impact the gameplay. The assets are just for aesthetics.


### Level 1

### Level 2

### Level 3

# Week 8
Further assets were added to game levels 4 and 5, and now all the levels are visually completed.
The last 2 levels will contain enemies to increase the difficulty of the levels.
Each enemy will patrol an area if the player collides loser screen will be shown.

### Level 4
![image](https://github.com/rahman0002/Mobile-Game-Project/assets/91261400/9730b4b1-70a6-46bf-bd0d-479659f36b18)
### level 5

This week further bug fix was done:
-	Now the player can complete each level and move to the next one without crashing.
-	Data persistence works for the game levels, now it unlocks and locks levels properly.


# Week 9 
This week focus is on bug fixes and improving game mechanics such as:
- The counter for collectibles is displayed properly on all levels
- In order to move to the next level all the stars have to be collected.
- Improvement for sphere physics, so it doesn't fall through the ground.

The counter and the condition to go to the next level are working on all levels.
Some improvement has been made for the physics, some occasions the sphere still falls through. The problem is with unity physics as is not intended to be used primarily this way.


# Week 10
Testing with particle and trail renderer.
Currently, the trail renderer is not functioning properly when moving from one level to another further testing is needed.
Particle will enhance the visual of the game when collecting objects, currently testing some default effects that Unity provides.


# Week 11
Week 11 objective was to fully finish the UI menu system for the game by adding all the assets and pages needed to complete the system.

### Main Menu
![image](https://github.com/rahman0002/Mobile-Game-Project/assets/91261400/d1dc964a-1ba4-4660-b362-271dd68baa2d)

For the main menu, I used some shares of the same colour throughout the system from the background image.
I tried to keep the colours uniform for buttons and assets used in the UI. 
This way it is more organised making the navigation more intuitive for the user.
 
### Option Menu

### Level Selection

### Pause Menu

### Game Over

### Winner Menu

All the menu pages are completed no further visual updates are needed right now.
Additionally, the volume slider works properly and now it saves the volume level throughout different sessions.
Added audio for the main menu, fully functioning.

# Week 12

In week 12, further advancements were made for ads.
Now the game runs ads in 2 ways:

1 – After level 1, there is a 40% chance that the system will show an AD to the player when selecting a level from the level selection menu.
This was made so that the monetisation is not too heavy on players, and it doesn't disrupt playability.

2 – Upon completing level 1, If the player has completed the level in under 30 seconds, before going to the next level an Interstitial Ad will play.
This applies to every level.


# Week 13 
After testing with a few devices, the application is ready to be released on Google Play Store.
This objective is to set up the game and load the aab file to the Google Play console for review and then publication.

The game uploaded waiting for review.


## Week 14
The game is online and available on Google Play Store.

Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TeamOf7.RollYourWay&pcampaignid=web_share

The app has been tested on multiple devices, and the app functions as intended.
if the phone has a gyro sensor, the user will able to play without any problem. In case the phone doesn't have a gyro sensor, the will open and load the game level but the user will not be able to play.
