doodle jump is classic  mobile game, very famous with simple mechanics but very addictive. Requires minimum effort from the user to play it.
Unfortunatly it doesn't have unique mechaniques that are available only on smartphones.
Remaking this game with my out twist, it will involve re-designing the gameplay by adding some unique features that benefit from the mobile phone hardware. 

## Game 2: Super rub a dub

Super rub a dub also another popular game but on console, The plader has to use gyroscope to move around and collect objectives.
A remake will require, a new theme with funny and interactive mechanics to revamp this type of gameplay.
