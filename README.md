# Mobile Game Project

# Introduction
For this project, the Rapid Prototyping methodology will be used, to create a quick prototype of the game to visualise simple mechanics and features,
to judge the variability of the game. 

# Week 1
Researching popular mobile games. 

# Week 2
## Research

Game 1: doodle jump
Doodle Jump is a classic  mobile game, very famous with simple mechanics but very addictive. It requires minimum effort from the user to play it.
Unfortunately, it doesn't have unique mechanics that are available only on smartphones.
Remaking this game with my twist will involve re-designing the gameplay by adding some unique features that benefit from the mobile phone hardware.
